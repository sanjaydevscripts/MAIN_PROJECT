# UNDER WATER PLASTIC DETECTION AND IMAGE ENHANCEMENT

main project

## INTRO

The Underwater Plastic Detection and Restoration project aims to develop a robust and intelligent system for identifying plastic waste in underwater environments. This system addresses critical challenges in marine pollution tracking by integrating advanced image enhancement techniques with real-time object detection powered by deep learning.

Combining Python-based image processing with the YOLOv11 detection model, the system enhances low-quality underwater images and accurately identifies plastic debris such as bottles, bags, and gloves. A user-friendly frontend and a scalable backend ensure seamless data flow from image capture to visualization. The project contributes to environmental monitoring and sets the foundation for future integration into autonomous underwater vehicles.

# TO RUN

connect rpi with display(rpi have memory with rpi os and that condain main.py file).rpi also connect to ethernet keyboard and mouse.
run the flutter app,upload one video,click one video that run in the display as soon.

# To run python code

open terminal in rpi os ,python main.py
it automatically create ngrok url save it in firebase
(first run python code then select video in app)
