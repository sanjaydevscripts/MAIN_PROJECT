# UNDER WATER PLASTIC DETECTION AND IMAGE ENHANCEMENT

main project

## INTRO

The Underwater Plastic Detection and Restoration project aims to develop a robust and intelligent system for identifying plastic waste in underwater environments. This system addresses critical challenges in marine pollution tracking by integrating advanced image enhancement techniques with real-time object detection powered by deep learning.

Combining Python-based image processing with the YOLOv11 detection model, the system enhances low-quality underwater images and accurately identifies plastic debris such as bottles, bags, and gloves. A user-friendly frontend and a scalable backend ensure seamless data flow from image capture to visualization. The project contributes to environmental monitoring and sets the foundation for future integration into autonomous underwater vehicles.
